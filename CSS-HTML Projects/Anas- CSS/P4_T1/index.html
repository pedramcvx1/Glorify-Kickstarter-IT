      <h3>The Begining</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Montserrat";>FOUNDED IN 1878 AS NEWTON HEATH L&YR FOOTBALL CLUB, OUR CLUB HAS OPERATED FOR OVER 140 YEARS. THE TEAM FIRST ENTERED THE ENGLISH FIRST DIVISION, THEN THE HIGHEST LEAGUE IN ENGLISH FOOTBALL, FOR THE START OF THE 1892-93 SEASON. OUR CLUB NAME CHANGED TO MANCHESTER UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB IN 1902, AND WE WON THE FIRST OF OUR 20 ENGLISH LEAGUE TITLES IN 1908. IN 1910, WE MOVED TO OLD TRAFFORD, OUR CURRENT STADIUM.</p>
    <h3>OLD TRAFFORD</h3>
    <p style="font-family :Montserrat"; >Our Old Trafford stadium, commonly known as "The Theatre of Dreams," was originally opened on February 19, 191   0 with a capacity of approximately 80,000. During the Second World War, Old Trafford was used by the military as a depot, and on March 11, 1941 was heavily damaged by a German bombing raid. The stadium was rebuilt following the war and reopened on August 24, 1949. The addition of floodlighting, permitting evening matches, was completed in 1957 and a project to cover the stands with roofs was completed in 1959. After a series of additions during the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s, capacity at Old Trafford reached 56,385 in 1985. The conversion of the stadium to an all-seater reduced capacity to approximately 44,000 by 1992, the lowest in its history. Thereafter, we began to expand capacity throughout the stadium, bringing capacity to approximately 58,000 by 1996, approximately 68,000 by 2000, and approximately 76,000 in 2006. Current capacity at Old Trafford is 75,454.</p>
    <h3>Munich Incident</h3>
    <p style="font-family: Montserrat";>In February 1958, an airplane crash resulted in the death of eight of our first team players. Global support and tributes followed this disaster as Busby galvanized the team around such popular players as George Best, Bobby Charlton and Denis Law. Rebuilding of the club culminated with a victory in the 1968 European Cup final, becoming the first English club to win this title.</p>
