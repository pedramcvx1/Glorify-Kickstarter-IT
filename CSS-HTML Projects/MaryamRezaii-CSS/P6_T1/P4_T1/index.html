		<p>The Airbus A380 is a large wide-body airliner that was developed and produced by Airbus. It is the world's largest passenger airliner. Airbus studies started in 1988, and the project was announced in 1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing 747 in the long-haul market. The then-designated A3XX project was presented in 1994; Airbus launched the €9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) A380 programme on 19 December 2000. The first prototype was unveiled in Toulouse on 18 January 2005, with its first flight on 27 April 2005. It then obtained its type certificate from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 12 December 2006. Due to difficulties with the electrical wiring, the initial production was delayed by two years and the development costs almost doubled.

			It was first delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and entered service on 25 October. Production peaked at 30 per year in 2012 and 2014. However, after the largest customer, Emirates, reduced its last order in February 2019, Airbus announced that A380 production would end in 2021. On 16 December 2021, Emirates received its 123rd A380, which was the 251st and last delivered by Airbus. The $25 billion investment was not recouped.
			
			The full-length double-deck aircraft has a typical seating for 525 passengers, with a maximum certified capacity for 853 passengers. The quadjet is powered by Engine Alliance GP7200 or Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofans providing a range of 8,000 nmi (14,800 km). As of December 2021, the global A380 fleet had completed more than 800,000 flights over 7.3 million block hours with no fatalities and no hull losses.</p>

		  <h2>Design</h2>
		  <p>The A380 was initially offered in two models: the A380-800 and the A380F.

			The A380-800's original configuration carried 555 passengers in a three-class configuration[149] or 853 passengers (538 on the main deck and 315 on the upper deck) in a single-class economy configuration. Then in May 2007, Airbus began marketing a configuration with 30 fewer passengers (525 total in three classes)—traded for 200 nmi (370 km) more range—to better reflect trends in premium-class accommodation.[150] The design range for the A380−800 model is 8,500 nmi (15,700 km);[151] capable of flying from Hong Kong to New York or from Sydney to Istanbul non-stop. The A380 is designed for 19,000 cycles.[152]
			
			The second model, the A380F freighter, would have carried 150 t (330,000 lb) of cargo over a range of 5,600 nmi (10,400 km).[153] Freighter development was put on hold as Airbus prioritised the passenger version, and all orders for freighters were cancelled.
			
			Other proposed variants included an A380-900 stretch seating about 656 passengers (or up to 960 passengers in an all-economy configuration) and an extended-range version with the same passenger capacity as the A380-800.[3]</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Wings</h3>
			<p>The A380's wings are sized for a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) over 650 tonnes to accommodate these future versions, albeit with some internal strengthening required on the A380F freighter.[3][168] The optimal wingspan for this weight is about 90 m (300 ft), but airport restrictions have limited it to less than 80 m (260 ft), thereby lowering the aspect ratio to 7.8 which reduces fuel efficiency[104] by about 10% and increases operating costs a few percent,[169] given that fuel costs constitute about 50% of the cost of long-haul aeroplane operation.[170]

				The common wing design approach sacrifices fuel efficiency on the A380-800 passenger model because of its weight, but Airbus estimates that the aircraft's size and advanced technology will provide lower operating costs per passenger than the 747-400. The wings incorporate wingtip fences that extend above and below the wing surface, similar to those on the A310 and A320. These increase fuel efficiency and range by reducing induced drag.[171] The wingtip fences also reduce wake turbulence, which endangers following aircraft.[172] The wings of the A380 were designed in Filton and manufactured in Broughton in the United Kingdom. The wings are then transported to the harbour of Mostyn, where they are transported by barge to Toulouse, France, for integration and final assembly with the rest of the aircraft and its components.</p>

		<h1>Engine</h1>
		<h3>The A380 is offered with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 (A380-841/-842) or the Engine Alliance GP7000 (A380-861) turbofan engines.[154] The Trent 900 is a combination of the 3 m (118 in) fan and scaled IP compressor of the 777-200X/300X Trent 8104 technology demonstrator derived from the Boeing 777's Trent 800, and the Airbus A340-500/600's Trent 500 core. The GP7200 HP core technology is derived from GE's GE90 and its LP sections are based on the PW4000 expertise.[155] At its launch in 2000, engine makers assured Airbus it was getting the best level of technology and they would be state-of-the-art for the next decade, but three years later Boeing launched the 787 Dreamliner with game-changing technology and 10% lower fuel burn than the previous generation, to the dismay of John Leahy.[156]

			Due to its modern engines and aerodynamic improvements, Lufthansa's A380s produce half the noise of the Boeing 747-200 while carrying 160 more passengers.[157] In 2012, the A380 received an award from the Noise Abatement Society.[158]
			
			London Heathrow is a key destination for the A380.[3] The aircraft is below the QC/2 departure and QC/0.5 arrival noise limits under the Quota Count system set by the airport.[159] Field measurements suggest the approach quota allocation for the A380 may be overly generous compared to the older Boeing 747, but still quieter.[160][161] Rolls-Royce is supporting the CAA in understanding the relatively high A380/Trent 900 monitored noise levels.[162] Heathrow's landing charges having a noise component, the A380 is cheaper to land there than a Boeing 777-200 and -300 and it saves $4,300 to $5,200 per landing, or $15.3M to $18.8M of present value over 15 years. Tokyo Narita has a similar noise charge.[163]
			
			Sufficient braking capacity allowed for thrust reversers to be installed on only the inboard engines.[164][165] The outboard engines lack them, reducing the amount of debris stirred up during landing.[166] The reversers are electrically actuated to save weight, and for greater reliability than pneumatic or hydraulic equivalents.</h3>

		<center><h2>Cost</h2></center>
		<p2>As of 2016 the list price of an A380 was US$432.6 million.[328] Negotiated discounts made the actual prices much lower, and industry experts questioned whether the A380 project would ever pay for itself.[90] The first aircraft was sold and leased back by Singapore Airlines in 2007 to Dr. Peters for $197 million.[329] In 2016, IAG's Willie Walsh said he could add a few, but also that he found the price of new aircraft "outrageous" and would source them from the second-hand market.[308]

			AirInsight estimates its hourly cost at $26,000, or around $50 per seat hour (when configured for only 520 seats), which compares to $44 per seat hour for a Boeing 777-300ER, and $90 per seat hour for a Boeing 747-400 as of November 2015.[330] The A380 was designed with large wing and tail surfaces to accommodate a planned stretch; this resulted in a high empty weight per seat.[308] The stretch never occurred to take advantage of this, and the A380's cost-per-seat is expected to be matched by the A350-1000 and 777-9.</p2>
